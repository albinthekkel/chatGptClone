# ChatGPT Clone with Backend

## Introduction

This project is a clone of ChatGPT using the GPT-Neo model from EleutherAI. It consists of a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a text generation server based on Flask. The goal is to demonstrate technical and collaboration skills in setting up and deploying a text generation service.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js
- npm

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 2. Install Docker Compose

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 3. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from Azure DevOps:
```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <cloned_directory_name>
```

## Deployment
### 1. Deploy the ChatGPT Clone
In the root directory, run the following command to build and launch the Docker containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Run the Backend
In `/backend` directory, install the dependencies and run the server:
```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

## Usage
### Chatbot Endpoint
POST /chat

Example payload:

```bash
{
  "input": "How are you?"
}
```

Example response:

```bash
{
  "response": "I'm fine, thank you!"
}
```

## Testing
### Run Backend Tests
In `/backend` directory, run the tests with the following command:
```bash
npm test
```

## Project Details
### Project Structure

- **server.js:** Main backend server file using Node.js and Express.
- **server.test.js:** Test file for the backend server.
- **serve.py:** Text generation server based on Flask using GPT-Neo.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Configuration file for Docker Compose defining the necessary services.

### Project Structure
The `docker-compose.yml` file configures and launches two services:
- **chatgpt:** Text generation server using GPT-Neo.
- **backend:** Backend server that interacts with the text generation server.

### Environment Variables
- **MODEL_NAME:** Name of the GPT-Neo model to use. Default is `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m`.

### Running with Serveo
To make the server publicly accessible, use Serveo:
```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:3001 serveo.net
```
Share the URL generated by Serveo so that anyone can access the service.
